## Fuzzy logic based temperature controller

In a heating application, control of nonlinear processes of heating is required. Applying good control techniques can increase the life span of mechanical parts and also save energy by optimising the energy consumption. Different types of controller methods are used in industrial applications like On/Off control, proportional, integral and differential control (PID) and fuzzy logic based control.

In this project I have selected an electric unit heater where the heating is controlled by an electric coil. Desired value of the temperature in the unit heater is 25 0C, where
a range of 24-26 0C is also permitted. It is identified that the temperature of the environment can vary from -5 0C to 40 0C. Power input to the heating coil of the system is a pulse width modulation signal (PWM). This PWM signal to the heating coil needs to be given from the fuzzy logic based temperature controller.
